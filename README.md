# Image-Detection
This repository contains the code and instructions for a Computer Vision Face Detection Lab. The lab utilizes AWS Recognition, a face detection and analysis service provided by Amazon Web Services. The lab demonstrates various tasks related to face recognition and manipulation using the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) and other Python packages.


1. Creating a collection in AWS Recognition.
2. Uploading an image to search for faces.
3. Adding the image to the collection and detecting faces.
4. Viewing the bounding box around the detected face in the image.
5. Listing faces in the collection and detecting emotions.
6. Searching for a face in the collection and finding matches.
7. Drawing a bounding box around the discovered face in a target image.
8. Deleting the collection.
